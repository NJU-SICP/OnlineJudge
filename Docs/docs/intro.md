This is the documentation for judging system used in Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (SICP) course at Nanjing University.

This repository uses some code from UC Berkeley, but is not for UCB's Okpy of CS61A.

To fetch the source code of online judge, run the following command in terminal:

```shell
$ git clone git@github.com:NJU-SICP/OnlineJudge.git sicp-oj
```

If you want to run or develop the online judge, you shall install these software (tools) on your computer:

- Java (at least Java11) and Gradle
- Python3 and venv (`python3-venv`)
- Node and Yarn
- Docker (Docker Desktop or `docker-ce`), and `docker-compose`

You can read the rest pages to learn about how to run the online judge or to develop each component of the online judge.
